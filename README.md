This project is a theory trainer for the German sailing license. It is best used with a smart phone and randomly selects questions, which will progress through
a number of levels, that determine, when or if a question will be asked again in the future.

Besides the personal task to learn those questions, I also heard recently about elm as functional language for website development and was eager to experiment with
it.

The learn progress and configuration data is only stored locally in the browser.
